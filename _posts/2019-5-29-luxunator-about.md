## About Me

As a kid i always been into puzzles and learning and was that one nerdy one that always brought rubiks cubes, metal brain teasers, and books to school (Yeah Yeah Major Cringe). I didn't really start my interest in Cybersecurity until hearing some people online talk about Anonymous (Yes sorry even more major cringe and no i don't have interests in them still) and decided to message some people that I saw connected to some of the events. He brought me in on some groupchats and introduced me to some people. After about 5 month of just drama and skid talk I found myself in a hidden IRC and some very technical talk going on that started to really intrigue me. Little did i know this would start me on down the "Rabbit Hole". Fasting forward a while I learned alot from these people and got past some learning curves. Eventually I started programming and doing alot of hacking. Met some great people along the way and eventually started this WeebSec community to share what I learn and help others get started
