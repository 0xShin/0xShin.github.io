What's up friends?! I am Shin your personal hacking companion and this is my first post in this blog,I am so excited! Anyways I will be introducing myself and how I got into hacking so let's start.

## About Me
It's always been the same story with the other guys or you, As a kid I always love playing games that consists of using our brain especially puzzles and like Luxunator I was one of those kids who's a angel who always brought books and just sit in the corner and just tryna learn and yes I do get lonely sometimes(so lonely). I didn't really have a interest in infosec until much lately in my teenager days when I saw  that a local hacking group(bloodsec) defaced Globe's website(a Internet Service provider) in my local news starting from that I trained and studied a lot about web security until now and It's actually hard but fun to do especially since there's a lot of things to discover on the web. Eventually I met some good friends time to time especially in WeebSec and because of them we are starting a blog under the banner of WeebSec to help you guys.

## My interests
- Programming
- Pentesting
